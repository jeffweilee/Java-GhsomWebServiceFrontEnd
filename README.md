# GhsomWebService Web FrontEnd

## About the Web
	- A interface to process web sessions properties for backend program to fit GHSOM neural network models
	- Allow user to create projects by uploading web session properties files into database and to build GHSOM tasks. 
	
## About The GHSOM Architecture and Training Process
Refer to [The Growing Hierarchical Self-Organizing Map](http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/~andi/ghsom/)
- We input web sessions properties fit GHSOM neural network models and to find out similarity by their feature vector representations.
